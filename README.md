###  2. Create a new folder and open the folder in VSCode
###  3. New a terminal, then run  the command to create a package.json file.
     "npm init -y" 
###  4. Run the command "npm init playwright@latest" to install Playwright
     Choose TypeScript between JavaScript and TypeScript
     Name of your tests folder, default is tests
     Add a GitHub Actions workflow to run tests on CI easily
     Install Playwright browsers, default is true.
### 5. Create a new folder "pages" which will contain all page objects.
### 6. Create a new file under the root folder and name it .env which will store the credential
     NOTE: DO NOT push it to GitHub, add its file path to gitignore
### 7. Create a new test file and class file under the folder "tests" and "pages" separately for each page, 
For example, login.spec.ts and LoginPage.ts
### 8. Create element locators and action methods for the corresponding page in the class file.
### 9. In the test file, import the page class, create an instance, and use methods to implement the workflow.
### 10. Run this command  to check the result.
     npx playwright test
